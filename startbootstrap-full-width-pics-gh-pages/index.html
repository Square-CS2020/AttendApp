      <p class="lead">We aim to simplify the attendance process for both student and professor</p>
      <p>For the learning environment, there have been times where attendance can become tedious and over redundant. What we are working to deliver is a remedy to that 5 - 10 minute waste before class where nothing gets done so those 
	involved will not feel the need to rush.
	We at square have had these problems and are working to finally
	create a solution that will satisfy students, professors, and the learning environment they belong too. </p>
	
	<h1 id="details">Our Project in More Detail</h1>
	<p class="lead">The easy part</p>
	<p>It is a small matter to create a program that takes in an inpout and gives a correct response. When a student enters a specified number within the
	time alloted. The next step is to specify what response the professor should get based on what time the student has entered their code. The color codes
	are Green for present and on time, Yellow for present but late, and Red for absent. These color codes are not the final choice and there will be more
	colors for different situations such as present but left early.</p>
	
	<p class="lead">The hard part</p>
	<p>The process we are going to use is having a 10 - 8 digit code number that the student will have to enter. The code number will be a combination
	of part random number that the professor will provide and a number that is unique to the student. This allows a way to cut down on some of the foul 
	play, but not all, such as if a student checks in without actually being in the classroom. What we want to spend most of our time on is a way for both
	professors and students feel comfortable using our system and have faith that both parties are being taken care of.</p>
